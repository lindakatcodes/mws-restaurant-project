#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.

## Project Overview: Stage 1

In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

## Project Overview: Stage 2

In **Stage Two**, you will take the responsive, accessible design you built in Stage One and connect it to an external server. You’ll begin by using asynchronous JavaScript to request JSON data from the server. You’ll store data received from the server in an offline database using IndexedDB, which will create an app shell architecture. Finally, you’ll work to optimize your site to meet performance benchmarks, which you’ll test using Lighthouse.

## Project Overview: Stage 3

In **Stage Three**, you will take the connected application you built in Stage One and Stage Two and add additional functionality. You will add a form to allow users to create their own reviews. If the app is offline, your form will defer updating to the remote database until a connection is established. You'll also add functionality that allows users to favorite or unfavorite a restaurant. Finally, you’ll work to optimize your site to meet even stricter performance benchmarks than the previous project, and test again using Lighthouse.
